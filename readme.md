# SimPadLib

## What is this?
- This is a python library programmed by Willow Rubenstein that allows users to interface directly with their SimPad devices, and control
RGB values pragmatically. It allows for you to use all included features in the official SimPad app, but using Python instead.
- It includes comprehensive research of all of the different functions for the SimPad.

## What is a SimPad?
- A 2-key keypad used for osu! and similar 2-key rhythm games

# Roadmap
- NodeJS port by the end of January (this never happened btw)
- I begrudgingly made a C# library on 7/17/22, fight me
